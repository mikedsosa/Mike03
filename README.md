First Client based deliverable

Description:
"Our (pretend) client this week is Joel Hilton (my brother, who is 2 years, 2 months, and 2 days
younger than myself), who is very into movies. So into movies, in fact, that he minored in Film
Studies at BYU, contracts as a movie reviewer for ClearPlay, and does a weekly podcast about
movies called Baconsale with a couple friends. He needs a system to keep track of his movie
collection. (He only allows movies he deems worthy into his collection… although when I asked
him if it was okay if I used his spreadsheet as an example for my assignment this week, he asked
me to make sure it’s understood that he married into some of these films.) 

He needs a web app to be able to more easily enter and keep track of his movie collection as it
grows. Create a web app that has:

• A shared navigation menu to each page on the site

• A home page containing the title “The Joel Hilton Film Collection”

• A separate “My Podcasts” page with a link to the Baconsale site: https://baconsale.com/

• A separate page with a form to enter the movies. The new movie form should allow to enter
all the information currently contained in the spreadsheet linked above. Note:
o For the Rating field, use a dropdown menu (G, PG, PG-13, R).
o For the Edited field, we want that to be a yes/no (true/false) option.
o The “Edited”, “Lent To”, and “Notes” fields are optional. All other fields must be
entered.
o Notes should be limited to 25 characters.
• A separate page that lists out all the movies that have been entered so far (just while the app
is running – we have not learned yet how to connect it to a database for long-term storage.)
o NOTE: Exclude the movie “Independence Day” from ever displaying in the list,
because Joel once argued in a 4
th of July podcast that “Independence Day” beats
“Rocky IV” as the “Most American Movie Ever Made” which is obviously not true!"
